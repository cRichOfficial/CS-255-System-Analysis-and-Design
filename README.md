# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

- **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project focuses on developing an online platform to allow clients to register and schedule online training as well as in-person driving training. The client, DriverPass, is a small driver education company looking to capitalize on an untapped market.

- **What did you do particularly well?**

One of the things I believe I've done particularly well is the UML class design of various objects within the DriverPass system. My class diagram clearly shows inheritance between objects as well as composition and aggregation.

- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

One part of my documentation that I would revise would be the sequence diagram showing the sequence of actions involved in purchasing and scheduling training. I should have involved better description of the sequence of events when dealing with writing and reading data from the database. That process could have been laid out much more clearly.

- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

When interpreting user needs, it's important to ask qualifying questions about what the user says their needs are. Are user may say one thing about what they need, but after some probing and qulification, you and the user may have a better understanding of what their needs actually are. When DriverPass says they don't want to worry about security and maintenance and just want to focus on running the business, there is some interpretation that is left to that without qualifying what the need actually is. Do they want the system to be "perfect" without the need for updating and security, or do they want this managed on a contract basis? It's important to consider these needs and get a full understand from both the system designer poinit of view, as well as the client.

- **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

After this class, I have definitely realized the importance of the different stages of the System Development Lifecycle. It is incredibly important to collect system requirements via interviewing or polling business users, as well as examining existing systems in place. Going forward, I will utilize all aspects of the SDLC when designing systems and work with my team to make sure these principals are adhered to. To analyze system requirements, I think a combination of interviewing and group conversation goes a long way in determining system requirements. From there in person interaction to analyze how the current system is used. Writing unit tests and automating testing sequences will help find issues within the new system design. After implementation, it's increadibly important to have a proper maintenance plan and communication method in place. Software such as ServiceNow or Jira can facilitate this process.
